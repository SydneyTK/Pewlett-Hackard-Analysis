## Overview 
After reviewing the statistics outlining the number of employees set to retire from Pewlett Hackard managment got concerned. We had previously provided statistics on the number of employees set to retire, a by department breakdown, and who is eleibgle for a mentorship program to help the transition from old to new staff. We were now asked to look at the bucket of elibile retieries and report on the titles these individuals hold, as well as, the number and type of staff eligible to entre the mentorship program. 
## Results 
How can we help the managers prepare: 
### Deliverable 1
* Engineers, from multiple levels from assistant to senior, are going to be the type of employee greatest affected by the reitrement wave. Roughly 50% of the people retiring hold an engineer position. Therefore this needs to be the type of employee most focused on with the mentorship program. 
* Support staff such as leaders, staff, and senior staff are somewhat affected but manager poitions are not really affected at all. These should be a seconary focus.

### Deliverable 2
* The mentorship  program has 1,549 currently employed and eligible employees to participarte
* After a quick COUNT analysis of the engineer types only 169 senior engineers, 501 engineers, and 78 assistant engineers are eligible for the program. This is still quite low compared to the number of employees retiring found in deliverable 1, but is at least a starting point.  
## Summary 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
After a count analysis 90,398 roles will need to be filled. 
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Ironically as answered above there is not quite enough retirement ready employees, but the numbers of those born in 1965 is still a great start to this retirement mentorship program. 
### Additional query/table ideas 
* As a manager I would be curious to know in my department how many of each role/title are retiring. AKA a by department bu title breakdown.  
* It would be great to know how many people are expected to retire per year. As a manager I would want to know how quickly this 'silver tsunami' is going to hit. Will I loos alot of people at first, is it a steady distribution amoungst the years, or will everyone be retiring at the end?
